The notebook consists of 4 parts. The 1st one should be ignored as it is not an efficient technique to read our data.

Used a simple CNN model: 
  conv(3,3)->conv(3,3)->maxpool(2,2)->conv(3,3)->conv(3,3)->conv(3,3)->maxpool(2,2)->dense(128)->dense(62)->dense(3)

Achieved an accuracy of 98.3%

For training purposes. Feel free to use the code in any way you want :D
